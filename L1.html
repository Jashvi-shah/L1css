    <h1> Harry Potter and Potter heads</h1>
    <p id="para1">The Harry Potter series follows the life of a young orphan, Harry Potter, who learns on his 11th birthday that he is a
    wizard. He attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he finds friendship, magical learning, and
    adventure. Alongside his best friends Ron and Hermione, Harry uncovers secrets about his past, including the truth about
    how his parents were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. Each year at Hogwarts brings new dangers, magical
    creatures, and pieces of the larger mystery surrounding Voldemortâ€™s return to power.
    
    As the series progresses, Harry becomes the key to stopping Voldemort, who seeks immortality and control over both the
    magical and non-magical worlds. The final battle between good and evil takes place at Hogwarts, where Harry and his
    friends fight to protect everything they love. In the end, Harry defeats Voldemort, proving that love, bravery, and
    friendship can overcome even the darkest of forces.
